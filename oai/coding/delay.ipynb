    "The `delay` variable in the provided code is used to store and manage the estimated delay of the received signal, which is crucial for accurate channel estimation and subsequent signal processing. This variable helps in compensating for any timing misalignment between the transmitted and received signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed analysis of how the `delay` variable is used in the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The `delay` variable is initialized to zero before the channel estimation process begins:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "delay_t *delay = &gNB->ulsch[ul_id].delay;\n",
    "memset(delay, 0, sizeof(*delay));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that any previous delay estimates are cleared, and the delay variable is ready to store new estimates for the current processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating Delay\n",
    "\n",
    "During the channel estimation process, the delay is estimated based on the received signal and the known reference signal (DMRS). This estimation typically involves calculating the cross-correlation between the received and reference signals to determine the timing offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For DMRS Type 1 with Frequency-Domain Interpolation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "nr_est_delay(gNB->frame_parms.ofdm_symbol_size, ul_ls_est, (c16_t *)pusch_vars->ul_ch_estimates_time[aarx], delay);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `nr_est_delay` is a function that estimates the delay. It uses the OFDM symbol size, the least squares channel estimates (`ul_ls_est`), and other parameters to calculate the estimated delay.\n",
    "- The result is stored in the `delay` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying Delay Compensation\n",
    "\n",
    "After estimating the delay, it is necessary to compensate for this delay in the channel estimates to correct any timing misalignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Apply Delay Compensation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int delay_idx = get_delay_idx(delay->est_delay, MAX_DELAY_COMP);\n",
    "c16_t *ul_delay_table = gNB->frame_parms.delay_table[delay_idx];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_delay_idx` is a function that converts the estimated delay into an index for accessing a delay compensation table (`ul_delay_table`).\n",
    "- `ul_delay_table` contains precomputed values for compensating different delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "for (int n = 0; n < 3 * nb_rb_pusch; n++) {\n",
    "    for (int k_line = 0; k_line <= 1; k_line++) {\n",
    "        int k = pilot_cnt << 1;\n",
    "        c16_t ch16 = c16mulShift(ul_ls_est[k], ul_delay_table[k], 8);\n",
    "        // Further processing with delay compensated channel estimate (ch16)\n",
    "        pilot_cnt++;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The channel estimates (`ul_ls_est`) are multiplied with the corresponding delay compensation values from `ul_delay_table` to obtain the delay-compensated channel estimates (`ch16`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reverting Delay Compensation\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it may be necessary to revert the delay compensation applied earlier. This is typically done by applying the inverse of the estimated delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Revert Delay Compensation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int inv_delay_idx = get_delay_idx(-delay->est_delay, MAX_DELAY_COMP);\n",
    "c16_t *ul_inv_delay_table = gNB->frame_parms.delay_table[inv_delay_idx];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The inverse delay index is calculated, and the corresponding inverse delay table (`ul_inv_delay_table`) is accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "for (int n = 0; n < 3 * nb_rb_pusch; n++) {\n",
    "    for (int k_line = 0; k_line <= 1; k_line++) {\n",
    "        int k = pilot_cnt << 1;\n",
    "        ul_ch[k] = c16mulShift(ul_ch[k], ul_inv_delay_table[k], 8);\n",
    "        ul_ch[k + 1] = c16mulShift(ul_ch[k + 1], ul_inv_delay_table[k + 1], 8);\n",
    "        // Further processing with the reverted delay compensated channel estimate\n",
    "        pilot_cnt++;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The previously delay-compensated channel estimates (`ul_ch`) are multiplied with the inverse delay compensation values from `ul_inv_delay_table` to revert the delay compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The `delay` variable is initialized to zero before starting the channel estimation process.\n",
    "2. **Delay Estimation**: The delay is estimated using the `nr_est_delay` function, which calculates the timing offset based on the received signal and known reference signal.\n",
    "3. **Applying Delay Compensation**: The estimated delay is used to access a precomputed delay compensation table (`ul_delay_table`), and the channel estimates are adjusted accordingly.\n",
    "4. **Reverting Delay Compensation**: If needed, the delay compensation can be reverted by applying the inverse of the estimated delay using an inverse delay compensation table (`ul_inv_delay_table`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `delay` variable plays a crucial role in ensuring that the timing alignment between the transmitted and received signals is accurately maintained, which is essential for reliable channel estimation and subsequent signal processing steps."
